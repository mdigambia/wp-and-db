## A Little Context

I sit at the intersection of design, anthropology, and programming. These three are at the core of everything I make. Combining them into a  coherent career is a weird and ongoing challenge.

Titles and  disciplines are fickle and fleeting. But my work fits under the  umbrellas of UX design, interface design, HCI, DX (developer  experience), and interaction design. With some cultural analysis,  writing, and visual illustration sprinkled on top.

I currently lead design at **[HASH](https://hash.ai)** where we're developing open-source, interoperable systems to improve the way we structure knowledge on the web.

I'm not currently avaliable for any contract work, side projects, or full-time roles.

Before HASH I spent five years at the developer education company  **[egghead](https://egghead.io)**. First as the art director and lead illustrator where I spent my time  figuring out how to visualise invisible programming concepts through  metaphors and cultural symbols. Then as the UX designer exploring  pragmatic ways to improve the interface for learners.

On the side I create **[illustrated essays](https://maggieappleton.com/essays)**  and visual explanations about programming and culture. I'm an advocate of **[digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)**, **[end-user programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_development)**, and expanding our use of **[embodied cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition)** and **[conceptual metaphors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor)** in digital interfaces.



## A Little History

I'm originally from London but grew up in international schools in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand, and Singapore.

I earned my undergraduate degree in **[cultural anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_anthropology)**   at a small, hippie, liberal arts college in the United States. While I  adore anthropology, it's not terribly employable (unless you want to be  an academic or a military advisor) and I promptly switched into  freelance design and illustration to pay rent. I started developing my  visual design skills at age 14 when I first bootlegged a copy of  Photoshop to make my own icon sets, but never realised you could get  paid for that.

In my early twenties I country-hopped while working through the early, ugly, awkward phase of my design sensibilities. I  worked with web developers in Vietnam, trained with feature film  illustrators in Los Angeles, and learned typography and brand design at  creative agencies in Prague. I made a lot of hideous stuff, but figured  out what I liked along the way.

I eventually returned to London to become a more settled, "normal" adult, and have come to love the dull stability of home.
