# DBI - Spreadsheet as a Database

A. Camariana, E. Touray & E. Faal

---

In this assignment, we are going to use excel as a database to structure our projects (Restaurant) data.

Remember what we discuss in class about how spreadsheet can be use as a database to structure data before actually implementing the real database.

We will use this idea to do our restaurant project and fill in the real data before implementation.

Here is the model

[Mariama's Restaurant Model - drawn on the board in class]

## Steps

1. Create a new spreadsheet file and called it **restaurant**
2. Now look at the model above and create a sheet for each entity
3. Next, use the model again to create the columns/attributes for each specific entity.
4. Next fill in some real data from the restaurant you are solving this problem for. ( May be a week/months worth of real data from the restaurant).
