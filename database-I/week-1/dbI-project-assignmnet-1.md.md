For this project assignment, we need two groups, each group will solve one problem. The problems are different in terms of the specific domain they come from, but similar approach is needed to solve both problems.

You are to come up with a problem statement base on what we discuss in class (what data modeling is and the basic buildings block of data modeling). You problem statement should be no more than a page.

Here are the group names

- Group Fig - Mariama's Restaurant
- Group Dawn - The Barber Shop
