# Project base approach

The Idea is to do small accomplish able projects. We shift our focus from websites to web application from day 1

1. Phonebook (Put all the CRUD functionalities there - build component by component)
2. Passo ()
3. Posting (If there is time)

## Steps

  - secondary-phone (optional)
  - email (optional)
  - address

Reading Journal - MDN server side programming (students to get familiar with what we are about to do)
